# Twitter Sentiment Analysis 🐦

A well-known project to **analyze the sentiment of tweets** using Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, and other libraries. Great for learning text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classical machine learning! 🚀

## Features ✨
- Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming  
- Feature extraction using `TfidfVectorizer`  
- Sentiment classification with **Logistic Regression**  
- Evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix  
- Visualization of results and word clouds

## How it Works 🧩
1. Text preprocessing: Clean tweets with regex, tokenize, remove stopwords, and stem words.
2. Feature extraction: Convert tweets into TF-IDF vectors.
3. Model training: Train Logistic Regression on the training set.
4. Evaluation: Measure accuracy and visualize predictions with a confusion matrix.

This pipeline provides a simple yet effective sentiment analysis workflow for Twitter data.
